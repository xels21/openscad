# Summary

along with making my own anti-z-wobble design and successfully installing and using it, I drilled out the original z-axis top mount lead screw hole (to allow the lead screw to move more freely but also as the holes on my acrylic were to small and were actually causing the lead screw to bind)

though the Z-axis wobble now vanished I had to now put up with the lead screw jiggling about which if Im honest was annoying the crap out of me (specially when the printer is returning to home position and the lead screw bounces about like crazy (tbh I cant see it being to healthy for the already bent screw and the coupling either)

so after a quick look round thingiverse for what I wanted I couldnt find anything that really suited my needs (I wanted something simple, original looking and fitted in with what was already in place), again everything seemed a tad over engineered for my tastes.

all I wanted was something as close to similar to the original top mount as I could get with the facility to except a loose fitted bearing to stabilize the 8mm lead screw, it didnt need to be a solid fitted bearing and it didnt need to be supportive, just act as a guide to stop the lead screw flying all over the place.

couldnt find anything so again started from scratch.

heres my almost identical to original top mount design with a adaptions made to except a loose fitting F608ZZ 8mm bearing.

must say, works a treat..... even if I do say so myself

Notes: 
this design works best with a Z-Axis anti-wobble mod (or "floating z-axis") which helps eliminate any effect created by minor distorted z-axis lead screws.

I use it with my own design and has so far proven perfectly effective in eliminating any and all z-axis wobble effects.
